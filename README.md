# Interview Evaluation

In this repo you will find two sections for evaluation. These sections are not related and should be considered indepently. Please take the time to review this code and come prepared to talk about any changes you would make to improve readability, accuracy, and organization.

There are two sections to review: the database section and the programming section.
### [Database Section](https://github.com/streck-it/InterviewEvaluation/tree/main/DatabaseSection)
There is a sql script creating a table to store infromation about consultants.  Please review this table for optimization, normalization, and consistency.
    
### [Programming Section](https://github.com/streck-it/InterviewEvaluation/tree/main/ProgrammingSection)
The programming section contains functionality to work with employees. These functions are meant to not require any outside dependencies.  

The [DataSeeder.cs](https://github.com/streck-it/InterviewEvaluation/blob/main/ProgrammingSection/DataSeeder.cs) file is meant to serve as a method to generate data and give an example of what data could look like.  The DataSeeder.cs file is not in scope and does not need to be examined.

[Employee.cs](https://github.com/streck-it/InterviewEvaluation/blob/main/ProgrammingSection/Employee.cs) is the object representing the information about an Employee.

[EmployeeFunctions.cs](https://github.com/streck-it/InterviewEvaluation/blob/main/ProgrammingSection/EmployeeFunctions.cs) contains code that will query and modify a collection Employees.

Please review the code below and come prepared to talk about any changes you would make to improve readability, accuracy, and organization of the code.It is important to note there is no correct answer here. This is just an exercise to evaluate your ability to read and understand code.  As well as to see how you collaborate with other members of the team about the code.
